This is a brick that enables you to generate the boilerplate code of creating a new feature
in the clean architecture setup and layer-based folder structure.

You can easily select the following:
    1- The feature name
    2- The base classes names
    3- The state management (provider & bloc)
    4- The use cases you want to include in the feature
